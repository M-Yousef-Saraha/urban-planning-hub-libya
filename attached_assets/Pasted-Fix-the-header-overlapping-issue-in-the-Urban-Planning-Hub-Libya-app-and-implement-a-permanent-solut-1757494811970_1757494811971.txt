Fix the header overlapping issue in the Urban Planning Hub Libya app and implement a permanent solution to prevent future occurrences when adding new pages or features.

**CURRENT PROBLEM:**
- Fixed header (src/components/Header.tsx) with `fixed top-0 w-full z-[70]` overlaps with first menu items
- Page content containers use `py-8` starting from top, causing overlap
- Issue worsens when adding new navigation items or pages

**REQUIRED FIXES:**

1. **Calculate Dynamic Header Height:**
   - Create a CSS custom property `--header-height` that automatically adjusts
   - Use JavaScript to measure actual header height including mobile menu
   - Update the custom property dynamically when header content changes

2. **Implement Global Layout Solution:**
   - Add `pt-[var(--header-height)]` or equivalent to all main content containers
   - Replace `py-8` with `pt-[calc(var(--header-height)+2rem)] pb-8` in:
     * src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.tsx (line 13)
     * src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (line 150)
     * Any other page containers

3. **Create Reusable Layout Component:**
   - Build a `<PageContainer>` component that automatically handles header spacing
   - Include proper RTL support and responsive behavior
   - Ensure it works for both admin and public pages

4. **Future-Proof Navigation System:**
   - Add CSS classes that automatically adjust spacing when nav items are added
   - Implement proper mobile menu height calculation
   - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox with proper gap calculations

5. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Test with different screen sizes and orientations
   - Verify mobile menu doesn't overlap with content
   - Check that new pages automatically inherit proper spacing
   - Ensure Arabic RTL layout works correctly

**PREVENTION MEASURES:**
- Document the layout system in code comments
- Create utility classes for consistent spacing
- Set up linting rules to catch hardcoded margin/padding on main containers
- Implement automatic spacing that adapts to header height changes

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- No visible overlap between header and content on any screen size
- Adding new navigation items doesn't break layout
- All existing and future pages automatically inherit proper spacing
- Mobile menu displays completely without covering content
- Solution works seamlessly with Arabic RTL layout

Apply this fix systematically across all pages and components, ensuring a permanent solution that prevents this issue from recurring when new features are added.
